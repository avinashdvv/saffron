This needs a big ka-pow. Like, holy shit this thing is awesome.
MVP also needs essentials that don't give the app an all-or-nothing approach.

- edit HTML & css directly
- Design editor using editor = litmus test
- animation editor (like photomotr but better)
- mini preview

#### Hooks

- import sketch diagrams as SVG.

#### post MVP

- collaborative editing
  - notes
  - sync changes across devices
- compones -> cross-platform compilation
  - compile native ios apps
- specify platform you're building for
- flow-based diagrams - wiring up views with code & pre-built logic
- convert basic shapes to different data types (SVG -> div). This is like rasterization.
