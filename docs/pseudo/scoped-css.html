<!-- 
  Scoped styles are used to define isolated styles within a particular element. This tiny
  addition to the <style /> element makes it easier to keep CSS closer to the element that's getting styled.
  Scoped styles can also be defined within the root node
-->

  <link scoped type="text/css" href="./style.css" />
  
  <!-- this is transpiled to css -->
  <link scoped type="text/scss" href="./style.scss" />
  
  <div>
    
    <!-- same style node as W3C style. "Scoped" attribute is defined here to limit the style
    declaration to the parent element -->
